# Slow Pong

[![License][license-badge]](LICENSE)

Variant of Pong. Only slow balls count towards your score, and only fast balls
count towards the CPU's score. To slow down a ball, press `Space` before
hitting it. This will also slow down your paddle for a moment, so be careful not
to let any fast balls slip by. There is a cooldown between uses of the slow paddle.
First one to score 11 points wins. The game prints the score in the terminal.
